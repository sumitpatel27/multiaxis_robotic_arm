# multiaxis_robotic_arm
In this Robot arm project, we have made prototype of multi axis robot, in this robot 5 degree of freedom is used. Designing part has been performed in solid works first and then major parts get 3D printed while some parts get laser cuts. Robot can sort colour cubes and make stack of same colour. This project involves designing of robot parts, assemblies, attributes to perform required tasks, mechanism, inverse kinematics application, programming. All the required location is asked before program initialization in X and Y position manner. In addition, simple trigonometry is used to solve inverse kinematics to get all angles for servo to move gripper at required position. Using this variable robotic arm can automatically do its task in any board and cube position. Sorting colour is performed by colour sensor, which use colour temperature data, and all colours have specific range to distinguish colour. To pick up or drop off cube, robot arm having ultrasonic sensor at gripper point, which decide Z axis to get required height to move up or down.
